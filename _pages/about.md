I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working on mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. This is my personal website on which I wish to keep a summary of my academic and non-academic activities. For my university website, see <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ie257">here</a>.

I work in an area of mathematical logic called model theory. Model theory aims at identifying the inherent differences between "theories"; the abstract logical properties that instantiate mathematical structures. A common theme is finding "diving lines" within which these theories behave tamely, and looking at the interactions between these dividing lines. Part of my research involves seeing how these model theoretic properties occur in combinatorial structures which are natural to theoretical computer science, where tameness corresponds to desirable algorithmic properties.
